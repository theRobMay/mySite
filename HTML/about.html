        <p>I'm a 25 year old who has decided after a 6 year career in the professional continuing education industry that I would like to shift gears. I have always had a love for PCs in general as I have been building gaming PCs since I was 13, so I figure that helping to design the applications we use on them is a logical step. I am very amateur-ish currently but plan to continue to hone my skills on the front end through the Austin Coding Academy course which I am currently enrolled in. I hope to keep this site up to date with links to my projects as well as with continuous updates to the page itself.  </p>
